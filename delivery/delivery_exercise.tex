\section*{1 a)}
$EIRP$ stands for effective isotropic radiated power. It is the measure of how much power is radiated by an antenna equally in all direction in reference with an isotropic antenna. For a transmitter it is denoted as $P_{TI}$,  known as effective isotropic transmit power and for a receiver it is denoted as $P_{RI}$, known as effective isotropic received power. In case of the transmitter, it is given by
\begin{equation*}
EIPR =  P_{TI}=\frac{P_TG_T}{L_T}
\end{equation*}
And in case of the receiver, it is given by
\begin{equation*}
EIPR = P_{RI} = \frac{P_RG_R}{L_R}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{flalign*}
P_T /P_R &= \text {transmitted/received power} &\\
G_T/G_R&= \text {gain of transmitter/receiver} &\\
L_T/L_R&= \text {feeder loss of transmitter/receiver} &
\end{flalign*}
